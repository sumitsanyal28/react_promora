                    <p>We believe that the flow of information between the school
                        and the audience should be smooth. So that people can get
                        the required information very easily, about the school for their kids.
                        It will also help the schoolâ€™s certain record to be stored in an organised
                        manner for a longer period.</p>

                        <h2>What Is PROMORA?</h2><br />
                        Promora is all about building a bridge in between to fill up the gap.
                        Making strategies to promote on social media, getting the required
                        information and will be passed on by us. Observing school works,
                        trends and challenges, we have thought of solving this problem by
                        developing a platform on social media, by the collection of
                        information from school, mentoring the school for the same &
                        by making it easy to available to the general audience.
